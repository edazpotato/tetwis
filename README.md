# Tetwis

A version of tetris made in Javascript.

The design is inspired by (READ: stolen from) [Tetrys](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tetrys/bnchicpgbdgahiecgofdabidjihblaff) by [Kristian Nessa](https://github.com/kris10ansn), but the code is completley different.
The code is based off of [Tetris-Javascript](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Tetris-JavaScript) by [Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeExplained), but has been heavily modified.


Canvas drawing API is garbage btw.
